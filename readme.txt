  * The Delta Forth .NET source code has been written entirely in C# and has
  approximately 4000 lines.
  * Refactored compiler code to bring it to the .NET 4 world.
  * It has been reported that the execution and compilation of both the compiler
  and the generated executables work flawlessy under Mono, the open
  source .NET implementation.
  * This software is free to use for any purpose. You are free to experiment
  with the compiler, its source code, compiled Forth programs, etc. Branching
  this code is not allowed, that is you may not create your own flavor of Forth
  based on the code provided here. If you have done anything fancy and you think
  that would be useful for other Forth enthusiast, please send me a note and I
  will incorporate your change in Delta Forth.
